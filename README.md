This is the place to gather feedback for the great mahabharat project, an MVP version of which is live at https://mb-verse.herokuapp.com.

The intention is to release an API for the Mahabharat data, and, then, to build a chatbot.

At the moment, the project tech-stack uses:

- `json` to store data
- `python` to process data
- `flask` for the front end
- `heroku` as the deployment and hosting service

This tech-stack is not scalable. Open questions:

- `mySQL` to store data or `postgres`? Or, something else?
- `OpenAPIspecs` for the API of `graphQL`?
-  Own web server for hosting or a cloud account?

Feedback, thoughts, and contributions welcome! Just log an Issue.
